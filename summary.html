            <h1>Summary:</h1>
            <p>
                This website was programmed by Jerry over the course of a weekend. If the margins and whatnot are off, I am sorry.<br>
                 I did not have time to add responsiveness for different sized screens, so this looks good on my monitor, but it might not on yours.<br>
                  If there is any problems, let me know. <b>Remember the Cookie points down below in the fine print!</b><br>
                I chose a design of 3 main pages. One for introducing the website, one for the town in Cairnholm itself, and one for the loop.<br>
                For the town, I chose the Priest Hole, the museum, and the birds on the island. I will now list their importance down below.<br>
                <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25%;">
                    <li>Priest Hole - This is the place Jacob and his Father stay at. This place is important because it's one of the main reasons Jacob comes to Cairnholm. When he calls the only phone on the island from home in the present, a drunk person picks up the phone and yells, "Piss Hole!"</li>
                    <li>The Musuem - This is the place that houses "Bog Boy" and is run by Martin. This place causes Jacob to realize that his grandpa's last words were not nonesense because of the "dead man" Martin's uncle Og aslo confirms that his grandpa lived there.</li>
                    <li>Birds - One of the main reasons Jacob was allowed to come was because his dad was writing a book on birds and Cairnholm happened to have alot of them. Miss Peregrine was also a bird who watched over Abe and also Jacob.</li>
                </div>
                The Loop is the most important location on Carinholm. It is set in September 3rd, 1943, and houses all of the peculiars that we meet.<br>
                 The Loop is the third and most important setting of the story. This is where the bulk of important events happen. The loop has housed Abe Portman and Jacob himself, and is essential to the story.<br>
                 The Loop provides the plot, with the peculiars being in trouble and needing Jacob to help them.
