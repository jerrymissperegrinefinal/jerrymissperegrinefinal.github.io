                <h3>Welcome to The Loop: September 3, 1943</h3><br>
                <p>While Cairnholm is a bleak, rainy, and unintresting island, the loop is a very intresting place. In place for over 75 years, this is the loop that kept many peculiars safe while it lasted. Notable peculiars include: Jacob Portman, Abraham Portman, Emma Bloom, Miss Peregrine, and Millard. Join us as you witness time repeat itself indefintly as a bomb is dropped on you everyday. Have fun!</p>
                <h3>Key events:</h3>
                <li>9/3/1943 - Loop Starts to be reset because of the bombing</li>
                <li>In the Past - Victor is killed by a hollowgast</li>
                <li>Recently - Jacob comes</li>
                <li>Recently - Miss Avocet arrives hurt and with a warning</li>
                <li>Recently - Mr. Barron sneaks in with hollowgasts and kidnaps Miss Peregrine, leaving the children to fight the hollowgast by themselves and then save her</li>
                <li>Recently - Jacob and the children get Miss Peregrine back and sail away towards the Mainland because the loop is gone, Miss Peregrine is hurt, and they aren't safe yet</li>
